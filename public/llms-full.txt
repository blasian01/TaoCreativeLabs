## Services

### AI Automation
We build automation systems for companies: workflows, agents, integrations, and internal copilots that reduce operational overhead and accelerate decision-making.

### AI Consulting
We help businesses adopt AI safely and effectively, including internal knowledge systems, custom model deployments, and strategic implementation roadmaps.

**Consulting Process:**
1. **Discovery** — Assess current systems, data landscape, and business objectives.
2. **Architecture** — Design a technical roadmap with models, infrastructure, data flows, and integrations.
3. **Implementation** — Build and deploy the system, including model selection, prompt engineering, and testing.
4. **Optimization** — Post-deployment monitoring, output refinement, and iteration.

**Consulting Principles:**
- Privacy-first: Data sovereignty, encrypted pipelines, minimal data retention by default.
- Practical, not theoretical: Grounded in production experience.
